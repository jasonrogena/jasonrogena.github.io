Signing Git commits using GPG isn&amp;rsquo;t a requirement in most projects. It is however a nice to have feature, especially in cases where it is important for you to have your identity as the commiter verified. This prevents, for instance, an impersonator from going undetected when they submit a commit as you.</description></item></channel></rss>
